I close my eyes and
I think of something nice.

all right and you said no.

She couldn't remember.

00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:45,960
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

91
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,000
and then she said
he's at school.

watch him get shaken down.

She isn't doing that.

130

Well, I hope not because
Greg is far too trusting.

go up there and talk to Greg?

will be perfect for each other.

Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

141
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,081
He got in some trouble at home.
He had to get away.

142
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,520
I found him sleeping behind
the store at the harbor.

143
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:22,480
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

144
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,320
Just like that
you let him move in?

145
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,160
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

146
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:29,840
And Downey, I've known
him since I was a kid.

147
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:32,560
Sally, his wife,
I know her from high school.

148
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,080
I dated her for like four
days in the eighth grade,

149
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,440
so technically she's my ex.

150
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,120
They seem really nice.

151
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah. Except for the fact that
every year they feel obliged

152
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:47,400
to bring me an eligible girl.

153
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,600
Maybe they think you're lonely.

154
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:51,601
Do I give off lonely to you?

155
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:53,320
Sometimes.

156
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:56,902
When I come to see you at the diner,
I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

157
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:00,120
Obviously yesterday was different.

158
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,520
What happened yesterday?

159
00:12:02,884 --> 00:12:04,400
Yesterday I was not hungry.

160
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,921
I came in with the sole purpose
of inviting you sailing.

161
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:08,880
You did?

162
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:11,942
I did.

163
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,960
Hey, turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

164
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:21,302
Yeah, let me check it for just a sec.

165
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,720
So, things are okay with Tommy?

166
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,640
The same.

167
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,400
Every day is the same.

168
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:35,160
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

169
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:38,202
If I do one thing differently,
I lose him.

170
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:44,240
What's the matter?
I've never seen you like this before.

171
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't know. I just, uh, I just
feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

172
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,080
That's because you're a good mother.

173
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,960
But you can't be everywhere
all of the times.

174
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,480
Hey, guys. Oh!
(LAUGHS)

175
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,480
How is it going?

176
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,441
We're good.

177
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:05,160
I was just wondering if I could
steal Jess away from you.

178
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,240
Sally's dying to talk to her.

179
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,000
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

180
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:12,983
No, no, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

181
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,120
Hey, just for the record,

182
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,182
I'm not interested.

183
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,742
Yo, what the fuck?

184
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:42,142
Wind's dropped down on us.

185
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,583
It's not dropped, it's gone.

187
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,160
You ever seen this before?

188
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:58,502
Yeah, yeah.
Just not quite so sudden.

189
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,760
Are we okay to get home?
There is no wind.

190
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,240
Yeah, yeah. We got an engine.
It's not a problem.

191
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:07,180
It's just, it's weird.

00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,302

Nothing showing up. Over.

winds and the father of Sisyphus,

task of pushing a rock up a mountain

only to have it
roll back down again.

307
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:50,719
That's a pretty shitty punishment.
What did he do?

308
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:54,439
He cheated Death. No, he made a
promise to Death that he didn't keep.

309
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:58,089
I studied it but I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving, please?

come back for these.

These are mine.

These are my keys.

317
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,879
They're mine.

318
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:40,939
Bullshit.

319

This is, this is my house key.

320
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:46,579
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

321
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:49,479
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

322
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:50,759
Yes.

323
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:52,759

Hello?

487
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:27,860
VICTOR: Where the fuck is everybody?

488
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:35,781
DOWNEY: Do you even know
where we're going?

489
00:42:42,502 --> 00:42:45,940
Well, we're just, just
walking for the sake of it.

490
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:51,438
You all right?

491
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,999
I feel like I know this place.

492
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:56,599
I recognize this corridor.

493
00:42:56,663 --> 00:42:59,999
Liners, they look pretty similar.

494
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:02,460
No, that's not it.

495
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:05,958
Jess, come on.

496
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:08,519
VICTOR: This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

497
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,758
DOWNEY: Yeah. 1932.

498
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,918
It is the same. See...
Here's where we boarded.

499
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:14,882
Oh, yeah.

500
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:17,439
Ae-o-lus.

501
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,198
Aeolus.

502
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,718
Aeolus was the Greek God of the
winds and the father of Sisyphus,

503
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:25,918
the man condemned by the Gods to the
task of pushing a rock up a mountain

504
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,758
only to have it
roll back down again.

505
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:29,958
That's a pretty shitty punishment.
What did he do?

506
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:33,479
He cheated Death. No, he made a
promise to Death that he didn't keep.

507
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:37,540
I studied it but I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving, please?

508
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:43,060
Hello?

509
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:50,318
SALLY: Heather?

510
00:44:51,382 --> 00:44:53,061
VICTOR: Hello!

511
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,780
Heather!

512
00:45:00,143 --> 00:45:01,558
Heather!

513
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:05,198
GREG: Sally. Please. Please.
I don't-I don't know where everyone is...

514
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:06,798
...but-but the ship's not deserted.

515
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:09,758
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

516
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:11,638
so let's just go to the bridge.

517
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:14,598
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

518
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:15,901
JESS: I saw someone.

519
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,360
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

520
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,780
Hello?

521
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,060
Hello.

522
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:21,518
Shit.
How did you get here so fast?

523
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:24,998
Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me.
We don't have much time.

524
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:26,638
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

525
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:27,518
He's dead.

526
00:46:27,582 --> 00:46:28,439
What?

527
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:30,878
No, no, no. I-I mean, he was dead.
He's-he's not dead now.

528
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:31,918
What are you saying?

529
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:35,878
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

530
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,718
Me, walking and talking with Greg.

531
00:46:39,782 --> 00:46:41,660
- Right. What?
- Shit.

532
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:49,138
There.

533
00:46:50,102 --> 00:46:51,318
There's birds.

534
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,118
No, that was Downey's body.

535
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:56,038
I just left Downey back there.
How did you get here so fast?

536
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:58,340
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

537
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,370
(SQUAWKING)

538
00:47:07,942 --> 00:47:11,940
No. Downey was there.
It was-It was Downey's body.

539
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:16,758
There are bodies
all over this ship.

540
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:20,558
Your body is on the floor at the
restaurant with a hole in your head.

541
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,918
Listen, I'm gonna do you a favor, okay?

542
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:25,038
I'm not gonna tell anyone about this.

543
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:29,318
It's the truth. Victor,
we gotta get off this ship right now.

544
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:31,278
You're saying there's two of you now.

545
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,378
Yes.

546
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,438
And I'm dead in the restaurant.

547
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:35,998
You were killed.

548
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,678
Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

549
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,758
Is Sally okay?

550
00:47:42,122 --> 00:47:44,198
See where I'm going with this, right?

551
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,038
I mean, if we are dead and
there's two of you,

552
00:47:46,102 --> 00:47:48,038
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

553
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,318
We should never have
boarded this ship.

554
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:52,038
I knew something was wrong.

555
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,618
I should've-I should've forced you to stay
on the yacht and then you'd all be alive.

556
00:47:55,682 --> 00:47:57,478
I've gotta tell you
I feel pretty alive right now.

557
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,442
- Soon you're gonna be dead, Victor.
- Hey, easy on the grabbing.

558
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:01,518
Everything that happened to you,
happened to you before.

559
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:03,238
I can't-I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

560
00:48:03,302 --> 00:48:04,238
Victor, you're just gonna die.

561
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:07,580
You will die and then-and then,
Downey and Sally and then Greg.

562
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,000

(GROANS)

564
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:24,660
I didn't do this.
I didn't do this.

565
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:41,918
GREG: All right, we're on the third level.
The bridge is exactly two floors above us.

566
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,118
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just gonna ignore it?

567
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:47,118
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

568
00:48:47,182 --> 00:48:50,860
You know, they see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off some steam.

569
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:02,638
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

570
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:05,158
Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.

571
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:08,598
They have skippers. I mean,
in your world right now maybe they don't.

572
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:13,860
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

573
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:17,300
Don't talk to me about my world.

Listen, listen to me.

Don't-Don't let them board.

to hurt you, right?

You tried to strangle me, remember?

Do something.

I don't know what to do.

- Is he dead? Is he dead?
- I don't know what to do.

We-We don't have much time.

Don't you point that thing at my...

624
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:39,137
- Move!
- (GUNSHOTS)

- Go!

(GUNSHOTS)

627

I hit her.
I think I hit her.

00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,078
What's going on?
Who was that?

629
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,037
It's starting all over again.
That's what's going on.

00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,638
- Oh, no.
- Let's go.

631
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:53,597
- No, we can't leave without Greg. Downey, please.
- We'll come back for Greg. I promise.

632
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:54,740
Let's go, come on!

We can change the pattern.
Don't you see?

634
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,437
We change the pattern, we're not trapped.
Then we get off this thing.

Oh, Jesus, she's fucking mad.

636

You think?

637
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,478
You have to listen to me.

638
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,917
No, I don't have to listen to you.

639
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,358
Yes, you think it was me
who fired that shot at you?

640
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:11,878
- I don't know.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

641
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:14,318
Could we just take a
breath here for a second?

00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:16,477
Okay, Jess,
I am prepared to listen to you

643
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,797
and even prepared to believe you,
but you gotta start making some sense.

644
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:22,438
I'm making perfect sense. I'm gonna get
Victor, then we get off this ship.

645
00:56:22,502 --> 00:56:24,020
Wait here.

646
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:28,358
And don't trust anyone.

647
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:31,237
If anyone comes, you shoot them.

648
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:32,718
What the fuck are you talking about?

649
00:56:32,782 --> 00:56:34,038
You shoot them.

650
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:36,260
What?

651
00:56:45,262 --> 00:56:46,958
(WHISPERING)
Victor.

652
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:49,499

It's me, Jess.

what the fuck happened to you?

659
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:49,060
A long story.

660
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:53,677
Where's Victor?

661
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:55,259
He's dead.

662
00:57:57,021 --> 00:57:59,300
He fell over the side.

663
00:58:00,702 --> 00:58:02,838
How do we know you didn't kill him?

664
00:58:02,902 --> 00:58:04,478
You don't.

665
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,320
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

666

667
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:15,598

00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:21,237
I said ignore it.

671
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:22,998
Where are you?
Call out.

672
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:27,358
No, I'm not just gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

He's-he's not dead now.

and she-she had blood on one side
of her face, and then I-I killed her.
