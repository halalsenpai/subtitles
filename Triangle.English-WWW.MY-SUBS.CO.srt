1
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,945
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

2
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,664
That's all it was.

3
00:00:56,665 --> 00:01:01,422
Bad dreams make you think you've
seen things that you haven't.

4
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:05,224
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

5
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:09,425
I close my eyes and I
think of something nice.

6
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:12,744
Like being here with you.

7
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,821
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:27,424
Shit.

9
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:53,064
Jack?

10
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,302
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

11
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,744
No.

12
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,664
Okay, thanks.

13
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,864
I cleaned everything
away, sweetheart.

14
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,584
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

15
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:42,023
They're clean and shiny.
Look. Look. You see?

16
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:45,743
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

17
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,304
Well, hello, sailor.

18
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,463
Hi!

19
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:22,904
Permission to come aboard?

20
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:26,383
Honey, hold this.

21
00:04:26,384 --> 00:04:30,863
So sorry we couldn't make it yesterday.
Somebody was working late again.

22
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:33,344
How're you doing, Sal?

23
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,864
I'm good. How are you?

24
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,264
I'm all right.

25
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:38,544
Look at you.

26
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:39,543
Do you like it?

27
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,943
You look great.

28
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,863
Really? I just
kinda threw it on.

29
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:44,824
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

30
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:47,383
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

31
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,744
I don't listen to what he says.
You know that.

32
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,544
I brought my really good friend, Heather.
She's so nice.

33
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:56,022
Promise me you'll be attentive.

34
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:59,344
How're you doing, man?

35
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:01,144
She's not to bring anyone.

36
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:05,223
You don't like her? Believe me, she's
the best looking of Sally's friends.

37
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:08,264
Which it doesn't say much.

38
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:10,344
I asked you not to.

39
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:14,822
You're living on a boat with an 18-year
old boy and you're saying no girls.

40
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,023
Greg, this is Heather.

41
00:05:17,024 --> 00:05:20,823
She's a very good friend of mine, and
I just thought you guys should meet.

42
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,223
Hi.

43
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,142
Hi.

44
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:29,263
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

45
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:32,464
Jess. You okay?

46
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:35,184
I don't think so.

47
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:38,782
Hey. What happened?

48
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,664
Hey. What's the matter?

49
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:44,863
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:47,064
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

51
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,823
What is it? Are you okay?

52
00:05:48,824 --> 00:05:50,784
I'm just tired.

53
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,984
Well, listen, we don't have to
go today if you don't want to.

54
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,944
No, we do. I-I wanna go.

55
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:59,502
You sure?

56
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,624
Yeah.

57
00:06:04,624 --> 00:06:06,024
Yeah.

58
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:09,703
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

59
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,583
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

60
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,303
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

61
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:21,144
So let's go sailing!

62
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,343
Okay.

63
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,184
Hey.

64
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,742
You okay?

65
00:07:58,464 --> 00:07:59,864
Is Greg okay?

66
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,743
He's fine. He's upstairs.

67
00:08:01,744 --> 00:08:03,943
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

68
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,223
I had this terrible dream.

69
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,623
What about?

70
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,744
I don't remember.

71
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,463
I wouldn't worry.

72
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:14,664
Apparently bad dreams cure
you of real life stress.

73
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:18,583
As indeed does champagne.
You want some?

74
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:21,423
Yeah.

75
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:24,424
Downey, wanna give me
a hand, please?

76
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:28,463
Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of the
Captain's, but yes, I will help you.

77
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:31,503
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

78
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:32,944
What?

79
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,703
I asked Jess if she was all
right and you said no.

80
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:38,183
You told me she was bringing
the little boy along.

81
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,903
When I was walking with her in
the harbor I asked where he was.

82
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,943
She couldn't remember.

83
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:46,023
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

84
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,063
and then she said
he's at school.

85
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,143
So?

86
00:08:50,144 --> 00:08:53,143
Well, it's Saturday.
Ain't no school today.

87
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:57,702
Her son goes to a special needs
school and it's open every day.

88
00:08:57,984 --> 00:09:00,942
Be nice to her.

89
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,223
All right.

90
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:03,303
All right.

91
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:05,544
Do you boys sunbathe together?

92
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,144
Sometimes.

93
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:12,463
The champagne is not great
but it is cold. Want some?

94
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:13,463
No thanks.

95
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:15,343
Okay, more for me.

96
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:17,583
Hey, how are you feeling?

97
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,623
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

98
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:24,903
You apologize one more time, and
I'm gonna throw you overboard.

99
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:28,303
Here.

100
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:29,584
You all right?

101
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:32,143
Yeah.

102
00:09:44,144 --> 00:09:46,623
He thinks we're a fishing boat.

103
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:49,782
He's gonna go hungry.

104
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,624
You want to steer?

105
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,104
Nah.

106
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:57,582
Go on.

107
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:01,583
Which way do I aim?

108
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:04,462
You're gonna aim that way.

109
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,622
It's easy, right?

110
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:12,624
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

111
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,183
At least there they talk.
They became friends.

112
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,263
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

113
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:18,583
So they're just friends.

114
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,184
Sally!

115
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,863
What do you want me to say? I'm
sorry she has a retarded son?

116
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:24,583
Yeah!

117
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:27,864
Well, I'm sorry. You know, that's
not Greg's problem, that's hers.

118
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,703
What is it, is it the shorts?

119
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:32,623
No! Heather, Greg's been my
friend for a really long time.

120
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,143
I can't just sit back and
watch him get shaken down.

121
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:36,663
She isn't doing that.

122
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:40,143
Well, I hope not because
Greg is far too trusting.

123
00:10:40,144 --> 00:10:42,104
I'm kinda linking the boy.

124
00:10:42,104 --> 00:10:45,264
Uh, no, you're not. Can you please
go up there and talk to Greg?

125
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,183
I really think the two of you
will be perfect for each other.

126
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:52,302
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

127
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:54,623
Jess, are you ready?

128
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,582
Yeah, let her go.

129
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:05,823
Yeah.

130
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:09,263
Woo!

131
00:11:10,224 --> 00:11:12,024
So, how do
you know everyone?

132
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,023
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

133
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,144
He got in trouble at home.
He had to get away.

134
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:18,583
I found him sleeping behind
the store at the harbor.

135
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:22,543
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

136
00:11:22,544 --> 00:11:24,383
Just like that
you let him move in?

137
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:27,223
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

138
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:29,903
And Downey, I've known
him since I was a kid.

139
00:11:29,904 --> 00:11:32,623
Sally, his wife, I know
her from high school.

140
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:35,143
I dated her for like four
days in the eighth grade,

141
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:38,503
so technically she's my ex.

142
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,183
They seem really nice.

143
00:11:40,184 --> 00:11:44,143
Yeah. Except for the fact that
every year they feel obliged

144
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:47,463
to bring me an eligible girl.

145
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,663
Maybe they think you're lonely.

146
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:51,664
Do I give off lonely to you?

147
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:53,383
Sometimes.

148
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:57,902
When I come to see you at the
diner, I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

149
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:01,183
Obviously yesterday
was different.

150
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:02,583
What happened yesterday?

151
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:05,263
Yesterday I was not hungry.

152
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:07,984
I came in with the sole purpose
of inviting you sailing.

153
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:10,343
You did?

154
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,942
I did.

155
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:19,023
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

156
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:21,902
Let me check it for just a sec.

157
00:12:26,384 --> 00:12:28,783
So, things are okay with Tommy?

158
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,703
The same.

159
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,463
Every day is the same.

160
00:12:32,464 --> 00:12:35,223
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

161
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:39,702
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

162
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:44,303
What's the matter? I've never
seen you like this before.

163
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:48,263
I don't know. I just, uh, I just
feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

164
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,143
That's because
you're a good mother.

165
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,023
But you can't be everywhere
all of the times.

166
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:56,543
Hey, guys. Oh!

167
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,543
How is it going?

168
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,504
We're good.

169
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:05,223
I was just wondering if I could
steal Jess away from you.

170
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,303
Sally's dying to talk to her.

171
00:13:07,304 --> 00:13:10,063
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

172
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:12,983
No, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

173
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:18,183
Hey, just for the record,

174
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:22,182
I'm not interested.

175
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:39,742
Yo, what the fuck?

176
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:43,142
Wind's dropped down on us.

177
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:46,583
It's not dropped, it's gone.

178
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:53,303
This is crazy.

179
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:55,223
You ever seen this before?

180
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:59,502
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

181
00:13:59,824 --> 00:14:01,823
Are we okay to get
home? There is no wind.

182
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,303
Yeah, yeah. We got an engine.
It's not a problem.

183
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:07,743
It's just, it's weird.

184
00:14:07,744 --> 00:14:10,502
Greg?

185
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,302
Is that normal?

186
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,502
Okay, I'm fucking
freaked, what the fuck.

187
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:00,502
Triangle to coast guard. Over.

188
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:05,462
Triangle to coast guard. Over.

189
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:07,983
Coast guard, go ahead. Over.

190
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:12,343
We've just gone from seven knots to absolute zero.
You've got anything unusual? Over?

191
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,103
Nothing showing up. Over.

192
00:15:15,104 --> 00:15:19,903
It's darkening up pretty quick out here.
Looks like an electrical storm. Over.

193
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:23,223
Help me.
Please. Can you hear me?

194
00:15:23,224 --> 00:15:25,863
Help me. Please, help me.

195
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:29,783
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

196
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:33,982
We hear you. What's your position?
Over.

197
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:39,822
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

198
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:44,623
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting it anymore. Over.

199
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:49,303
Distressed caller, make another transmission.
What is your position?

200
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:52,262
Greg?

201
00:16:07,464 --> 00:16:11,102
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

202
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,142
Cut it. Cut the sail.

203
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,743
Vic, get the main sail down.

204
00:16:45,744 --> 00:16:48,581
Get it down.

205
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:54,263
Vic!

206
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,902
No!

207
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,901
Get back.

208
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,103
Jess, take my hand.

209
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,463
Grab on.

210
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:19,702
Heather!

211
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:26,702
Grab on.

212
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,182
Heather!

213
00:17:39,704 --> 00:17:42,062
Vic!

214
00:18:08,024 --> 00:18:10,782
Jess.

215
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,303
Are you okay?

216
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:20,782
All right.

217
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:23,782
Downey?

218
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,983
Are you guys okay?

219
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,503
Have you seen Heather? She
got lost through the window.

220
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:31,662
No. Come on, come on.

221
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,702
Heather!

222
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:38,382
Heather!

223
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:41,783
Greg! Help me!

224
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,062
Sally. Sally.

225
00:18:44,063 --> 00:18:46,383
Just give me your hand.

226
00:18:46,384 --> 00:18:49,262
Heather!

227
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,063
Are you guys okay?

228
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,342
Yeah.

229
00:19:25,503 --> 00:19:28,142
Are you all right?

230
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:33,222
Tommy's at school, yeah?

231
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,222
He'll be looked after until we get back.
He'll be all right.

232
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,542
Thank God. Yo! Help us!

233
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:25,062
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

234
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:26,903
Oh, God.

235
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,943
Hey. Hey.

236
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:32,702
Wait.
Come on, over here!

237
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:35,383
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

238
00:20:35,384 --> 00:20:38,343
Yo, we need
some help down here.

239
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:42,142
Help us, please!

240
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:44,863
Hello. We need
some help down here.

241
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:48,382
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

242
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:52,021
Oh, thank God.

243
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:01,582
Jump, jump, jump.

244
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:05,462
Okay. Jess, come on, come on.

245
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:07,822
Jess. Come on.

246
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,943
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

247
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:13,902
Okay. You okay?

248
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:32,662
You okay? Yeah?

249
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,582
Hey.

250
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:38,782
How is it?

251
00:21:38,783 --> 00:21:43,181
See? I told you.

252
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,422
Hello?

253
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:01,623
Hello?

254
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,502
Hello!

255
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:09,863
Do we wait?

256
00:22:09,864 --> 00:22:11,462
No, let's go to the bridge.

257
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,223
We'll get the captain to put a
call out to the coast guard.

258
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:16,781
We'll get a search for Heather.

259
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:22,742
Come on.

260
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:26,142
Do you think Heather
would've made it on board?

261
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:27,222
Honey.

262
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:28,903
There's a chance, isn't there?

263
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:32,662
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

264
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:59,822
Hello?

265
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,782
Hello?

266
00:23:15,503 --> 00:23:18,221
Hello!

267
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:24,582
Somebody please help us?

268
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:28,941
Hello?

269
00:23:40,384 --> 00:23:42,703
Where the
fuck is everybody?

270
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:46,143
You don't even
now where we're going.

271
00:23:46,144 --> 00:23:50,422
Well, we're just, just
walking for the sake of it.

272
00:24:01,944 --> 00:24:04,342
You all right?

273
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:08,301
I feel like I know this place.

274
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:11,702
I recognize this corridor.

275
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:16,303
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

276
00:24:16,304 --> 00:24:18,702
No, that's not it.

277
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:21,182
Come check this out.

278
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,942
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

279
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:26,223
Jess.

280
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:28,862
Come on. Come on.

281
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:32,503
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

282
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,503
Oh, yeah.

283
00:24:35,504 --> 00:24:37,583
Aeolus.

284
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:40,222
Aeolus.

285
00:24:40,223 --> 00:24:43,702
Aeolus was the Greek god of the
winds and the father of Sisyphus,

286
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:46,862
the man condemned by the gods to the
task of pushing a rock up a mountain

287
00:24:46,863 --> 00:24:48,782
and let it see
roll back down again.

288
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:50,782
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

289
00:24:50,783 --> 00:24:54,502
He cheated Death. No, he made a
promise to Death that he didn't keep.

290
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:59,581
I studied it but I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving, please?

291
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:05,822
Hello?

292
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:28,942
Whoever it was might wanna
come back for these.

293
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,661
Let me see?

294
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,143
These are mine.

295
00:25:36,144 --> 00:25:37,462
These are my keys.

296
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:38,903
What are you talking about?

297
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:39,942
They're mine.

298
00:25:39,943 --> 00:25:41,302
Bullshit.

299
00:25:41,303 --> 00:25:43,382
This is, this is my house key.

300
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:47,342
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

301
00:25:47,343 --> 00:25:49,542
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

302
00:25:49,543 --> 00:25:51,623
Yes.

303
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:52,822
It's gotta be Heather.

304
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:53,902
Come on.

305
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:55,743
How else did they get here?

306
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:59,463
It was Heather dropping her keys but not
bothering to say, "I didn't drown."

307
00:25:59,464 --> 00:26:01,581
Why not?

308
00:26:02,543 --> 00:26:06,062
Come on.

309
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:11,542
Heather?

310
00:26:23,023 --> 00:26:27,702
Looks like you get your welcome
party, just not the welcome.

311
00:26:34,503 --> 00:26:36,063
Heather!

312
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:38,062
Yo, Greg, what time you got?

313
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,382
Eleven thirty.

314
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:43,022
Heather.

315
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:45,781
Heather!

316
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:51,983
Where is everyone?

317
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,542
Heather!

318
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:55,662
Sally! Please. Please.

319
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:59,182
I don't know where everyone is
but the ship's not deserted.

320
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:02,742
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

321
00:27:02,743 --> 00:27:04,302
so let's just go to the bridge.

322
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:07,502
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

323
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:09,543
I saw someone.

324
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,183
Fuck.

325
00:27:11,184 --> 00:27:13,741
Wait.

326
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,542
Hello?

327
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:43,703
Did you see who it was?
Was it Heather?

328
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,262
I didn't see.

329
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:48,942
I'm sorry.

330
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:50,423
Where're you going?

331
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:52,422
Why don't you
just help me out here?

332
00:27:52,423 --> 00:27:54,142
What?

333
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:56,781
Just wait for Vic.

334
00:27:59,103 --> 00:28:00,143
What?

335
00:28:00,143 --> 00:28:01,182
It's fine.

336
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:02,742
Why can't we go with him?

337
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:06,142
Let's just do as Greg says and
wait here for Victor, okay?

338
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,262
Fine.

339
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:08,862
I think Victor's in danger.

340
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:11,062
I'm not worried about Victor.

341
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:14,022
I'm sorry I'm acting weird.
It's just I'm having dÃ©jÃ  vu

342
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,663
every time I turn a corner.

343
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:16,942
No, no. No.

344
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:18,422
I know this place.

345
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,822
No, you don't know this place.
You're just in shock.

346
00:28:20,823 --> 00:28:22,302
That's funny.

347
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:24,342
What is it? What is it?
Is it Tommy?

348
00:28:24,343 --> 00:28:28,942
Is it guilt? Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

349
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:52,781
Hello?

350
00:29:31,663 --> 00:29:34,861
Hello.

351
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,822
Hello.

352
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:17,742
We're on the third floor. The bridge
is exactly two floors above us.

353
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:21,022
Greg, that was blood. Are
you just gonna ignore it?

354
00:30:21,023 --> 00:30:23,022
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

355
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:26,223
They see us, they get bored. They're
just letting off some steam.

356
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,142
What? They rescue us from the sea
and then they just hide for fun?

357
00:30:30,143 --> 00:30:32,542
Yeah.

358
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,502
Well, what's your theory?

359
00:30:34,503 --> 00:30:36,942
I don't know, but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

360
00:30:36,943 --> 00:30:39,942
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

361
00:30:39,943 --> 00:30:43,342
Jess, fuck! Don't you see that
this is all just in your mind?

362
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:46,702
Jess! Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.

363
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:52,061
They have skippers. I mean, in
your world right now they don't.

364
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:59,382
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

365
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:03,382
Don't talk to me
about my world.

366
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,781
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

367
00:31:24,303 --> 00:31:27,501
Is that blood?

368
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:33,102
Babe, come on, we're supposed
to meet them in the theater.

369
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:36,341
Heather!

370
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:39,622
Oh, my God. Shit.

371
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:41,902
Sally. Sal, come on.

372
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:45,141
Let's just go to the theater.

373
00:31:59,903 --> 00:32:02,982
Downey, I can't see anymore blood.
I don't think she's in here.

374
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:05,822
To be honest with you, I don't
think she's even on the ship.

375
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,661
Okay. So whose blood was that?

376
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:17,141
Hello?

377
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:22,341
Downey? Sally?

378
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:56,501
Victor. What happened?

379
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:29,141
Oh, my God.

380
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:48,622
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

381
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:50,901
Stay with me, man.

382
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,742
No. No!

383
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,062
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

384
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:58,102
What?

385
00:33:58,103 --> 00:33:59,662
He said you shot him.

386
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:01,262
I didn't!

387
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:02,422
Fucking liar!

388
00:34:02,423 --> 00:34:03,822
I wasn't even with Greg!

389
00:34:03,823 --> 00:34:07,822
He's dead! He's dead! Look!

390
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:10,501
God, you're a bitch!

391
00:34:15,663 --> 00:34:17,582
Get your hands off him!

392
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:21,141
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

393
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:22,702
Someone attacked him.

394
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:25,341
Someone?

395
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:26,942
You think I did it?

396
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:29,422
Why did you tell us
to come to the theater?

397
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:33,501
I didn't. I... Sally, I didn't.

398
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:35,021
I didn't.

399
00:34:35,022 --> 00:34:38,341
My God, you're
a fucking skitso.

400
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:41,661
Sally, no.

401
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,301
Sally!

402
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:54,900
No!

403
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:59,901
Downey!

404
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:02,342
Let it go. Let it go.

405
00:35:02,343 --> 00:35:05,061
No!

406
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:16,781
Don't shoot. Please.

407
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,101
Please, don't shoot. Please.

408
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:24,461
I have a son. I have a son.

409
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,141
Shit.

410
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:41,261
Who are you? Tell me!

411
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:43,660
Who are you?

412
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:46,502
What the fuck are you saying?

413
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:48,662
It's the only way to get home.

414
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:50,182
What?

415
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:53,061
You have to kill them.

416
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:57,061
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

417
00:40:56,783 --> 00:41:01,380
Over here. Come on. Hey!

418
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:05,302
Help us, please!

419
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:08,461
Help!

420
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,902
Hey. Hey.

421
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,621
Help us!

422
00:41:12,622 --> 00:41:13,902
Please!

423
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:17,701
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

424
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:20,661
Please!

425
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,262
Hello?

426
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:55,981
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

427
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:57,781
Let's go to the bridge.

428
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:02,100
We'll get the captain to put a
call out to the coast guard.

429
00:42:05,783 --> 00:42:08,540
Hello!

430
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:19,181
Hello?

431
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:29,860
Where the
fuck is everybody?

432
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:36,781
Do you even
know where we're going?

433
00:42:42,502 --> 00:42:46,940
Well, we're just, just
walking for the sake of it.

434
00:42:49,982 --> 00:42:51,501
You all right?

435
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,062
I feel like I know this place.

436
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,662
I recognize this corridor.

437
00:42:56,663 --> 00:43:00,062
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

438
00:43:00,063 --> 00:43:03,460
No, that's not it.

439
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:06,021
Jess, come on.

440
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:08,582
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

441
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:11,821
Yeah. 1932.

442
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,981
It is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

443
00:43:13,982 --> 00:43:17,502
Yeah. Aeolus.

444
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,661
Aeolus.

445
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:22,781
Aeolus was the Greek god of the
winds and the father of Sisyphus,

446
00:43:22,782 --> 00:43:25,982
the man condemned by the gods to the
task of pushing a rock up a mountain

447
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:27,821
only to have it
roll back down again.

448
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:30,021
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

449
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:33,542
He cheated Death. No, he made a
promise to Death that he didn't keep.

450
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:37,540
I studied him and I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving?

451
00:43:41,542 --> 00:43:44,060
Hello?

452
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:51,301
Heather?

453
00:44:51,382 --> 00:44:54,061
Hello!

454
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,780
Heather!

455
00:44:59,943 --> 00:45:01,621
Heather!

456
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:05,261
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

457
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:06,861
But the ship's not deserted.

458
00:45:06,862 --> 00:45:10,221
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

459
00:45:10,222 --> 00:45:11,701
so let's just go to the bridge.

460
00:45:11,702 --> 00:45:14,661
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

461
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:17,901
I saw someone.

462
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:01,780
Hello?

463
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:10,060
Hello.

464
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:21,581
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

465
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:25,061
Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me.
We don't have much time.

466
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:26,701
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

467
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:27,781
He's dead.

468
00:46:27,782 --> 00:46:29,102
What?

469
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,941
No, I mean, he was dead.
He's not dead now.

470
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:32,381
What are you saying?

471
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:35,941
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

472
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:39,780
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

473
00:46:39,782 --> 00:46:42,660
Right.

474
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:49,901
There.

475
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:51,381
There's birds.

476
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:53,181
No, that was Downey's body.

477
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:56,101
I just left Downey back there.
How did you get here so fast?

478
00:46:56,102 --> 00:46:59,340
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

479
00:47:07,942 --> 00:47:12,940
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

480
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:16,821
There are bodies
all over this ship.

481
00:47:16,822 --> 00:47:20,621
Your body is on the floor at the
restaurant with a hole in your head.

482
00:47:20,622 --> 00:47:22,981
Listen, I'm gonna do
you a favor, okay?

483
00:47:22,982 --> 00:47:25,101
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

484
00:47:25,102 --> 00:47:29,381
It's the truth. Victor, we gotta
get off this ship right now.

485
00:47:29,382 --> 00:47:31,341
You're saying there's
two of you now.

486
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:32,941
Yes.

487
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,501
And I'm dead in the restaurant.

488
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:36,061
You were killed.

489
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,741
Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

490
00:47:39,742 --> 00:47:41,821
Is Sally okay?

491
00:47:41,822 --> 00:47:44,261
See where I'm going
with this, right?

492
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:46,101
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

493
00:47:46,102 --> 00:47:48,101
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

494
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,381
We should never have
boarded this ship.

495
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:52,101
I knew something was wrong.

496
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:55,381
I should've forced you to stay on
the yacht and you'd all be alive.

497
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:57,541
I've gotta tell you I feel
pretty alive right now.

498
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,581
Soon you're gonna be dead. Everything
that happened to you, happened before.

499
00:48:01,582 --> 00:48:04,301
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

500
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:08,580
You will die and then, then
Downey and Sally and then Greg.

501
00:48:22,142 --> 00:48:25,660
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

502
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:41,981
We're on the third level.

503
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:45,181
Greg, that was blood.
You just gonna ignore it?

504
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:47,181
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

505
00:48:47,182 --> 00:48:50,860
They see us, they get bored. They're
just letting off some steam.

506
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:02,701
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

507
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:05,221
Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.

508
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:08,661
They have skippers. I mean, in
your world right now they don't.

509
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:13,860
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

510
00:49:14,382 --> 00:49:17,300
Don't talk to me
about my world.

511
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:31,620
Who are you?

512
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:36,740
Who are you?

513
00:50:29,102 --> 00:50:31,901
Who are you?

514
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:33,901
Listen, listen to me.

515
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:36,980
Please, you have to listen.

516
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,181
Kill them all.

517
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:43,140
If they board, kill them.

518
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:46,541
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

519
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,741
Please, you have to listen.

520
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:51,021
Don't let them board.

521
00:50:51,022 --> 00:50:54,221
No, no. No. Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

522
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:56,461
If they board, kill them.

523
00:50:56,462 --> 00:50:58,821
Jess. Jess, you
gotta kill them.

524
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,660
If they board, kill them.

525
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:04,500
No, no. No. Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

526
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:07,701
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

527
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:11,140
Fuck you!

528
00:52:10,061 --> 00:52:13,140
Shit.

529
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,220
Tommy.

530
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:36,740
Is that blood?

531
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:40,779
Babe, come on. We're supposed
to meet them at the theater.

532
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:08,140
Victor.

533
00:53:11,022 --> 00:53:12,981
I didn't mean to hurt you.

534
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:16,180
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

535
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:19,381
Now, I'm gonna try and get
us off this ship, okay?

536
00:53:19,382 --> 00:53:21,980
Sally.

537
00:53:22,502 --> 00:53:25,339
Sally?

538
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:31,060
Sally?

539
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:47,461
Victor?

540
00:53:47,462 --> 00:53:50,060
What happened?

541
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:07,179
You're not me.

542
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:24,540
You're not me.

543
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:57,099
You see? I'm not crazy.

544
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:03,300
Victor.

545
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:07,021
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

546
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:09,580
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

547
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:12,940
Now, you gotta be strong.
I'm gonna get the others.

548
00:55:17,141 --> 00:55:19,661
Downey, do something.

549
00:55:19,662 --> 00:55:21,260
Stay with me, man.

550
00:55:21,261 --> 00:55:23,020
Do something.

551
00:55:23,021 --> 00:55:24,461
I don't know what to do.

552
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:27,101
Is he dead? Is he dead?

553
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:30,699
Greg. Greg.

554
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,060
You fucking...

555
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:35,620
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
We don't have much time.

556
00:55:35,621 --> 00:55:37,101
Don't you point that thing.

557
00:55:37,102 --> 00:55:39,500
Move!

558
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:41,900
Go, go, go.

559
00:55:42,462 --> 00:55:44,621
I hit her. I think I hit her.

560
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,141
What's going on? Who was that?

561
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:49,500
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

562
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:50,701
Let's go.

563
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:52,260
We can't leave without Greg.

564
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:55,740
We'll come back for Greg. I promise.
Let's go, come on!

565
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:59,821
We can change the pattern.
Don't you see?

566
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:03,500
We change the pattern, we're not trapped.
Then we get off this thing.

567
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:05,380
She's fucking mad.

568
00:56:05,381 --> 00:56:06,380
You think?

569
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,541
You have to listen to me.

570
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,980
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

571
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:10,421
Was it me that shot you?

572
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:11,941
I don't know.

573
00:56:11,942 --> 00:56:14,381
Whoa, wait. Could we just
take a breath for a second?

574
00:56:14,382 --> 00:56:16,540
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

575
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:18,860
and even to believe you, but
you gotta make some sense.

576
00:56:18,861 --> 00:56:22,501
I'm making perfect sense. I'm gonna get
Victor, then we get off this ship.

577
00:56:22,502 --> 00:56:26,020
Wait here.

578
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:28,821
And don't trust anyone.

579
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:31,300
If anyone comes,
you shoot them.

580
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:32,781
What are you talking about?

581
00:56:32,782 --> 00:56:35,019
You shoot them.

582
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:37,860
What?

583
00:56:45,262 --> 00:56:48,020
Victor.

584
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:50,499
Victor?

585
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:20,500
I said who is it?

586
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,580
I said who is it?

587
00:57:40,142 --> 00:57:43,140
It's me, Jess.

588
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:47,020
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

589
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:49,860
A long story.

590
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:53,740
Where's Victor?

591
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:56,259
He's dead.

592
00:57:57,021 --> 00:58:00,300
He fell over the side.

593
00:58:00,702 --> 00:58:02,901
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

594
00:58:02,902 --> 00:58:04,541
You don't.

595
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,820
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

596
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:13,820
Downey!

597
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:15,661
Ignore it.

598
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,740
Downey!

599
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:19,181
What's going on?

600
00:58:19,182 --> 00:58:21,300
Is said ignore it.

601
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:23,061
Where are you? Call out.

602
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:27,421
No, I'm not just gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

603
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:29,221
Where
the fuck are you?

604
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:32,740
Call out! You're in danger.
You're in danger.

605
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:35,140
Who is that?

606
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:38,019
Not who you think?

607
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:47,659
So, what are we doing in here?

608
00:59:07,141 --> 00:59:08,820
Sally!

609
00:59:08,821 --> 00:59:11,419
Wait!

610
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:23,459
I'm sorry but I love my son.

611
00:59:26,621 --> 00:59:28,341
Sally?

612
00:59:28,342 --> 00:59:31,259
That wasn't me.

613
00:59:33,262 --> 00:59:35,980
Sally?

614
01:00:03,821 --> 01:00:06,419
Sally?

615
01:00:29,741 --> 01:00:32,101
Hello? Hello?

616
01:00:32,102 --> 01:00:34,421
Please, can you hear me?

617
01:00:34,421 --> 01:00:36,820
Help me. Please, help me.

618
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:38,500
She's killing everyone.

619
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,740
They're dead. They're all dead.
Please...

620
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:43,501
Sally?

621
01:00:43,502 --> 01:00:47,259
What's your position? Over.

622
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,900
Sally.

623
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:57,019
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

624
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:02,380
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting in anymore. Over.

625
01:01:02,381 --> 01:01:05,100
Greg.

626
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:08,499
Greg, is that you?

627
01:01:11,742 --> 01:01:15,540
Distressed caller, make another transmission.
What is your position?

628
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,659
Greg, can you hear me? Greg.

629
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:22,980
Shit.

630
01:01:30,901 --> 01:01:33,540
Sally?

631
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:41,259
Sally?

632
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,660
Oh, my God, what
happened to you?

633
01:02:34,661 --> 01:02:37,660
Get away from me.

634
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:41,939
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

635
01:02:44,221 --> 01:02:46,740
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

636
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:49,380
I don't know where he is.

637
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,740
You killed him.

638
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:53,140
What?

639
01:02:53,141 --> 01:02:56,460
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

640
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:57,621
What?

641
01:02:57,622 --> 01:02:58,900
I swear.

642
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,940
You're crazy.

643
01:03:00,941 --> 01:03:02,980
Why are you doing this?

644
01:03:02,981 --> 01:03:05,740
Sally, I know it's hard
but you gotta trust me.

645
01:03:05,741 --> 01:03:08,979
Gotta trust me, okay?

646
01:03:34,221 --> 01:03:36,260
Listen, you gotta hold on.

647
01:03:36,261 --> 01:03:37,780
I think it will return again.

648
01:03:37,781 --> 01:03:41,740
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

649
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:44,620
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

650
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:48,259
We'll re-board it and escape.

651
01:03:48,341 --> 01:03:51,499
Please.

652
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:55,780
Don't hurt me.

653
01:03:55,781 --> 01:03:59,019
Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you.

654
01:03:59,661 --> 01:04:01,820
If you hold on,

655
01:04:01,821 --> 01:04:05,299
you can see Downey again.

656
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:34,180
Hey, come on. Over here.

657
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:37,340
Hey. Hey. Help.

658
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:40,819
It returns when they're dead.

659
01:04:44,341 --> 01:04:48,579
It returns when
everyone's dead.

660
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:03,540
Do you think Heather
would've made it on board?

661
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:04,780
Honey.

662
01:05:04,781 --> 01:05:06,380
There's a chance, isn't there?

663
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:09,219
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

664
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,980
Stop this thing.

665
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:02,939
Stop this fucking thing.

666
01:06:21,501 --> 01:06:23,580
Please.

667
01:06:23,581 --> 01:06:26,819
I wanna go home.

668
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,939
I wanna go home.

669
01:06:54,981 --> 01:06:58,540
He's dead. I mean, he was dead.

670
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:00,660
He's not dead now.

671
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,940
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

672
01:07:02,941 --> 01:07:06,660
and she had blood on her
face, and then I killed her.

673
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:08,460
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

674
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:10,380
Listen, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

675
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:12,579
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

676
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,499
It's the truth.
You gotta listen to me.

677
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,780
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

678
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:21,419
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

679
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,699
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

680
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:57,939
I know how to save you.

681
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:11,579
You should try and eat, babe.

682
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:16,298
Jess?

683
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:28,820
Jesus, what happened to you?

684
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:30,380
Where's Greg?

685
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:32,940
Greg told me to tell you we
should meet in the theater.

686
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:35,619
There's a theater?

687
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,220
Yes, it's just that way.

688
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:39,739
Where are you going?

689
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:41,420
I'll see you there.

690
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:45,539
Okay, she's really starting
to freak me out now.

691
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,860
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

692
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:26,740
Ships don't just magically appear out of nowhere.
They have skippers.

693
01:10:26,741 --> 01:10:28,780
In your world right
now maybe they don't.

694
01:10:28,781 --> 01:10:33,740
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

695
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:37,219
Don't talk to me
about my world.

696
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:39,620
Jess.

697
01:10:39,621 --> 01:10:42,339
Jess, I'm sorry.

698
01:11:16,661 --> 01:11:18,899
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

699
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,860
Okay.

700
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,500
Take it easy, man.

701
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:26,379
Just take it easy.

702
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:31,139
What did we do? We're
not part of this boat.

703
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:34,620
We just got here, okay? We've been walking around.
There's no one on it.

704
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,780
I can go right now. I will go.

705
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:41,139
Okay? Just... Just take it easy.

706
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,020
Take it easy.

707
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:45,658
Okay?

708
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:53,100
Jess?

709
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,340
Jess.

710
01:11:55,341 --> 01:11:56,739
Jess, what are you doing?

711
01:11:56,740 --> 01:12:01,100
Wha... what is this?
Why... what are you wearing?

712
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:03,099
I don't want you
to see my face.

713
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,660
Why?

714
01:12:04,661 --> 01:12:06,980
Because this is not me.

715
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:11,499
I'm somewhere out there in the
yacht and you're with me.

716
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,380
And after I kill you,
we'll return.

717
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:18,418
Is that right?

718
01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:22,340
You know, why-why don't you
just put down the gun first?

719
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:25,019
Okay? Come on.

720
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,499
You see, the boat comes
back when you're all dead.

721
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,659
I've done everything
exactly like before.

722
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,460
But when the boat comes back,
I'll be ready, I'll be waiting.

723
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,740
I'll be on the landing bay. I won't let
any of them board, even the other me.

724
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:39,060
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

725
01:12:39,061 --> 01:12:40,340
Okay.

726
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:44,260
Jess, we'll do
whatever you want.

727
01:12:44,261 --> 01:12:48,458
Okay? Just, just
put down the gun.

728
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,339
Come on.

729
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,859
I'm so sorry.

730
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,338
No, no, no, no!

731
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:58,099
Greg!

732
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,940
Oh, God! What happened?

733
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:01,659
It was Jess.

734
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:05,300
You fucking bitch! You shot him.
He said you shot him.

735
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:06,780
I wasn't even with Greg!

736
01:13:06,781 --> 01:13:09,819
He's dead! He's dead!

737
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:13,939
My God, you're a
fucking skitso.

738
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:18,299
Downey!

739
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:31,618
Please.

740
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:33,419
Don't kill me.

741
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:35,899
I have a son.

742
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,699
I have a son.

743
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,819
Who are you?

744
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,899
Tell me!

745
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,499
They'll return.

746
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,260
Who are you?

747
01:16:01,261 --> 01:16:03,739
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

748
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,259
It's the only way to get home.

749
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,740
What the fuck are you saying?

750
01:16:06,741 --> 01:16:09,259
It's the only way
to save our son.

751
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,700
You have to kill them.

752
01:16:10,701 --> 01:16:13,938
Kill them? Kill them?

753
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:33,978
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

754
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,499
What's fun in buying you things

755
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,979
if you're gonna leave
them in the fucking garden!

756
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,099
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

757
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,979
I ain't buying you anymore toys if you
can't look after the ones you've got.

758
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,578
Now what?

759
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:30,498
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

760
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:35,339
Yeah, I'm just cleaning
the fucking mess!

761
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:41,699
What's the matter with you, huh?
What's the matter with you?

762
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:46,538
Just one day off is all I ask.
Just one fucking day off!

763
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:51,180
I don't know why you can't paint
a picture like a normal kid.

764
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,619
You get this from your father.

765
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:56,738
He was an asshole, too.

766
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,138
Shit.

767
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,259
Jack?

768
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,659
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

769
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,738
Tommy?

770
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,979
Sweetheart, come here.

771
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:11,418
Come here. Come here! It's okay.

772
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:20,458
Mommy's fine, you see?

773
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,698
Mommy's fine.

774
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,179
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

775
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,979
It's all it was.

776
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:35,098
Bad dreams make you think you've
seen things that you haven't.

777
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,738
Things are gonna be
different now, Tommy.

778
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,939
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

779
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,978
even when you do things wrong.

780
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:31,098
And she won't hurt you.

781
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,419
I know she won't hurt you.

782
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:36,699
You know how
I know that, Tommy?

783
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,459
Because that woman that did those
things to you is not Mommy.

784
01:23:40,460 --> 01:23:43,499
This is Mommy. Mommy's nice.

785
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:45,898
Shit.

786
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:51,858
Shit.

787
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:05,938
Tommy, stay in the car.

788
01:24:05,939 --> 01:24:08,938
I'm gonna bury it, okay?

789
01:25:06,979 --> 01:25:10,537
We have to go. We have
to get out of here.

790
01:25:13,819 --> 01:25:16,139
Stop screaming, babe.

791
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:18,898
Please, Tommy, is just blood.

792
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:20,739
Stop screaming!

793
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,418
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

794
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:26,577
See? There. It's gone.

795
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:54,738
Are you all right?

796
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,938
Who are you?

797
01:27:00,939 --> 01:27:03,537
Just a driver.

798
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:12,578
No point trying
to save the boy.

799
01:27:12,579 --> 01:27:16,378
There's nothing anyone can do
that's gonna bring him back.

800
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:21,698
Can I give you a ride?

801
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:27,339
Yes.

802
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:30,898
Take me to the harbor.

803
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:54,017
Hey.

804
01:27:58,019 --> 01:28:01,258
I'll leave the meter running.

805
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,377
You will come back, won't you?

806
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:14,618
Yes, I-I promise.

807
01:28:33,499 --> 01:28:35,658
Jess.

808
01:28:38,979 --> 01:28:40,699
Do you know me?

809
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:45,098
I feel like I do. Greg
talks about you enough.

810
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:47,819
Where is Greg?

811
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,818
Where do you think?

812
01:28:49,819 --> 01:28:51,778
Come on, you're late.

813
01:28:51,779 --> 01:28:53,859
You're the one
with the kid, right?

814
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:56,459
Yeah.

815
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,457
How come you didn't
bring him along?

816
01:29:05,219 --> 01:29:08,218
He's at school.

817
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,779
You sure about that?

818
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:13,498
Yes.

819
01:29:22,219 --> 01:29:23,499
Are you okay?

820
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,099
I don't think so.

821
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,418
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

822
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:33,098
Hey.

823
01:29:33,099 --> 01:29:34,781
I'm sorry.

824
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:38,857
You have nothing to apologize for.
What's the matter?

825
01:29:38,858 --> 01:29:40,780
I'm just tired.

826
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:43,417
Listen, we don't have to go
today if you don't want to.

827
01:29:43,418 --> 01:29:46,059
No, I do. I-I wanna go.

828
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:49,215
Are you sure?

829
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:55,621
Yeah.

830
01:29:55,622 --> 01:29:58,576
Yeah? Come, come here.

831
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,861
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

832
01:30:06,862 --> 01:30:09,580
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

833
01:30:09,581 --> 01:30:11,378
Let's go sailing.

834
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:14,218
Okay.
