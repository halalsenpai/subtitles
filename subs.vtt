he'd lost his mind.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:03.720
That the war
was too much for him.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:08.050
Then the man who cared for him
stopped speaking too.

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:12.820

before he stopped speaking...

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:15.960
that the virus

survivor still carries...

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:30.740
it would destroy humanity

Not by killing us...

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:38.080

things that make us human.

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.990
