00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.664
Sixty-three dead.

00:11:52.462 --> 00:11:54.672
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.969
What should we do with the humans?

00:12:41.887 --> 00:12:45.267
Do you think they will give him the message?

00:12:59.154 --> 00:13:02.494
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

00:13:44.825 --> 00:13:47.995
No one could have known how much darkness...

00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:51.076
...was living inside him.

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.780
Father...!

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:49.598
It was a long journey.

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.353
Father, we found something!

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:21.962
Mother...!

00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:31.814
Cornelius...

00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:34.268
Say hi to your brother!

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.358
Look who's here, son...

00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:58.578
Lake...

00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:29.821
This is it, father...

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.330
We can start over... A new home.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.120
What is beyond those mountains, son?

00:16:36.496 --> 00:16:38.246
Show them, Rocket...

00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:52.221
A desert!

00:16:52.638 --> 00:16:54.888
The journey is long...

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.730
But that is why humans will not find us.

00:16:58.268 --> 00:17:00.898
We must leave tonight!

00:17:01.313 --> 00:17:03.773
Tonight? That's impossible!

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.315
How long can we wait, Lake?

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.239
Soldiers getting closer!

00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:08.278
Winter...

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.827
Your son's been gone, Caesar...

00:17:20.791 --> 00:17:24.251
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:29.674
I know you are scared...

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.471
We all are...

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:35.971
But we are still planning...

00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:23.791
Stay here, son!

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.120
Protect your mother and brother!

00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:11.959
Caesar! What's wrong?!

00:20:12.754 --> 00:20:13.844
How many on patrol?

00:20:14.715 --> 00:20:15.675
Five? Six?

00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.134
Get them!

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:30.041
I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.564
Caesar...

00:23:50.848 --> 00:23:52.598
We can't find Winter!

00:23:55.394 --> 00:23:59.194
He was scared! I think he betrayed us!

00:24:03.527 --> 00:24:06.527
Have you found Cornelius yet?

00:24:07.948 --> 00:24:10.198
We're still searching.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.830
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.

00:25:35.452 --> 00:25:39.042
You're not coming with us to our new home?

00:26:02.729 --> 00:26:04.019
Caesar!

00:26:04.356 --> 00:26:06.266
You're not going after them?!

00:26:10.487 --> 00:26:14.487
Caesar, you are our leader!

00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:17.035
We can't leave without you!

00:26:22.624 --> 00:26:24.834
Father!

00:26:37.973 --> 00:26:39.853
Where is he going?!

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.650
Caesar! Caesar!

00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:38.582
The soldiers' camp is always moving.

00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:40.945
My guards think they know where it is.

00:27:41.203 --> 00:27:42.453
Let me take you.

00:27:42.788 --> 00:27:45.118
You need me to back you up!

00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:49.839
Please...

00:27:50.546 --> 00:27:53.376
I know what it's like...

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:55.379
...to lose a son.

00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:04.638
That's why I'm coming.

00:28:06.395 --> 00:28:09.235
To make sure you do.

00:28:45.934 --> 00:28:48.144
Guards think soldiers here...

00:28:48.478 --> 00:28:50.808
Always fires burning.

00:29:04.203 --> 00:29:05.753
No one here...

00:30:08.267 --> 00:30:10.137
What's he doing out here alone?

00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:12.444
Maybe he's a deserter?

00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:27.803
Something wrong with her.

00:33:27.841 --> 00:33:29.301
I don't think she can speak.

00:33:51.865 --> 00:33:55.945
She'll die out here alone.

00:34:03.377 --> 00:34:05.247
I understand...

00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:08.918
But I cannot leave her.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.040
Did you find the Colonel?

00:35:51.026 --> 00:35:52.146
He's gone.

00:35:55.614 --> 00:35:56.994
He left this morning...

00:35:58.075 --> 00:36:00.205
...took many men with him.

00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:03.663
More soldiers are coming down from the North.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.540
The Colonel is going to meet them...

00:36:07.209 --> 00:36:08.789
...at the border.

00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:18.854
I don't know.

00:36:19.346 --> 00:36:21.886
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

00:36:23.976 --> 00:36:27.306
The donkeys think the soldiers from the North...

00:36:27.771 --> 00:36:31.231
...are coming to help finish off the apes for good.

00:36:32.276 --> 00:36:35.146
That day, after the battle on the hill...

00:36:35.654 --> 00:36:39.164
The donkey we caught promised me the Colonel
would spare my life...

00:36:39.408 --> 00:36:42.828
If I told them where you were hiding.

00:36:44.288 --> 00:36:46.998
Forgive me!

00:38:14.837 --> 00:38:17.257
Now what do we do?

00:38:17.631 --> 00:38:19.261
Wait till the soldiers go...

00:38:20.342 --> 00:38:23.222
Follow them to the Colonel.

00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:17.066
The soldiers are leaving!

00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:12.867
What are they shooting at?

00:42:01.813 --> 00:42:03.483
Like her!

00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:06.691
He cannot speak!

00:42:10.364 --> 00:42:13.584
He will die of those wounds.

00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:48.071
Where did the soldiers go?!

00:42:52.322 --> 00:42:54.372
Yes, but which way is that?!

00:46:56.859 --> 00:46:58.189
Who are you?

00:46:58.819 --> 00:47:01.149
What are you doing here?

00:47:03.824 --> 00:47:05.664
I don't think he understands.

00:47:08.579 --> 00:47:10.209
I don't recognize him.

00:47:10.664 --> 00:47:12.504
He's not one of us.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:39.730
Amazing...

00:49:40.022 --> 00:49:42.192
Always thought we were the only ones.

00:49:42.524 --> 00:49:44.734
Wonder if there are more in the world?

00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:48.817
More apes like us.

00:50:46.922 --> 00:50:48.592
A deserted military camp!

00:50:48.966 --> 00:50:51.376
On the border!

00:50:51.969 --> 00:50:56.259
Maybe the Colonel and the troops are going there?

00:55:43.552 --> 00:55:44.892
Thirsty.

00:55:46.889 --> 00:55:48.639
Thirsty.

00:55:51.768 --> 00:55:52.728
Thirsty.

00:56:18.462 --> 00:56:20.382
What are they doing?

00:56:25.886 --> 00:56:29.386
What's that? A patrol?

00:56:41.443 --> 00:56:42.783
I saw them coming!

00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:17.439
At least this time...

00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:20.316
I was able to protect you.

00:58:31.386 --> 00:58:33.426
Caesar...

00:58:35.224 --> 00:58:37.564
This must stop...

00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:39.891
It's not too late to join the other apes...

00:58:40.729 --> 00:58:42.979
We cannot turn back!

00:58:44.233 --> 00:58:45.903
Luca gave his life!

00:58:46.443 --> 00:58:47.863
Please...!

00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:03.043
Now...

00:59:03.961 --> 00:59:06.761
...you sound like Koba.

01:00:58.492 --> 01:01:02.162
They came out of nowhere...

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:04.463
Attacked us.

01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:07.627
We thought they would kill us all...

01:01:08.043 --> 01:01:10.343
But the Colonel stopped them!

01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:14.131
There was madness in his eyes!

01:01:14.174 --> 01:01:19.054
He said they would use us, before we died!

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:22.021
And they brought us all here!

01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:30.022
They've been forcing us to work!

01:05:09.576 --> 01:05:11.036
Father!

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:14.790
Father!

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:41.173
Forgive them.

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:43.882
We've been through much.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.050
Father!

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.430
We haven't had food or water since we got here...

01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.340
Hurry! Back to work!

01:15:15.724 --> 01:15:16.934
Must save them!

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:18.135
But how?

01:15:18.185 --> 01:15:19.355
Must think!

01:15:19.603 --> 01:15:21.943
What would Caesar do?

01:25:38.347 --> 01:25:40.057
Soldiers everywhere!

01:25:40.307 --> 01:25:41.677
How will we get in?

01:25:43.185 --> 01:25:45.155
Must get in somehow...

01:25:45.562 --> 01:25:47.062
Must get in!

01:27:07.102 --> 01:27:09.482
You saved our lives!

01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:52.734
Sick humans...

01:27:53.023 --> 01:27:55.653
...must have escaped down here!

01:28:28.976 --> 01:28:30.686
Wonder where we are?

01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:08.653
Thirsty...?

01:34:38.387 --> 01:34:40.467
Humans will kill her!

01:34:41.932 --> 01:34:44.232
I know what to do! Go!

01:37:14.376 --> 01:37:17.916
Feeling better?

01:37:23.135 --> 01:37:23.975
Good.

01:37:24.261 --> 01:37:25.971
Then we can talk about...

01:37:26.763 --> 01:37:28.313
Escape.

01:37:29.224 --> 01:37:31.184
Apes together strong!

01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:32.810
Thirty-seven.

01:39:43.567 --> 01:39:44.687
Fifty-five.

01:39:47.154 --> 01:39:49.364
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage...

01:39:49.781 --> 01:39:51.871
Fifty-five to the children.

01:41:39.349 --> 01:41:40.929
Apes going back to the cage?

01:41:44.855 --> 01:41:46.275
You...

01:41:46.982 --> 01:41:48.112
Are very brave.

01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:50.780
Brave?

01:41:51.028 --> 01:41:52.148
Brave!

01:41:52.863 --> 01:41:54.323
Brave!

01:41:59.286 --> 01:42:00.446
Ape?

01:42:02.789 --> 01:42:03.789
Me...?

01:42:04.082 --> 01:42:05.632
Ape?

01:42:13.467 --> 01:42:14.797
You are...

01:44:54.127 --> 01:44:56.707
This is the ape I told you about!

01:44:58.799 --> 01:45:00.509
Thank you.

01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:40.758
What's wrong?

01:46:00.736 --> 01:46:01.856
We can't keep digging!

01:46:02.196 --> 01:46:04.356
It will flood the whole tunnel!

01:46:04.615 --> 01:46:07.415
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

01:46:27.095 --> 01:46:28.755
We must keep looking down there...

01:46:29.097 --> 01:46:30.927
Find another way to reach the children....

01:46:31.308 --> 01:46:33.058
We must leave now!

01:46:33.352 --> 01:46:34.772
More soldiers are coming!

01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:36.769
Humans will destroy each other!

01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:39.069
And us with them!

01:46:43.737 --> 01:46:45.567
We'll have to get the children out above ground!

01:46:46.448 --> 01:46:47.568
How...?

01:51:28.564 --> 01:51:29.904
Hurry! Let's go!

01:51:34.903 --> 01:51:36.743
Caesar, what's wrong?

01:51:50.043 --> 01:51:51.883
Without you?

01:51:52.504 --> 01:51:54.344
No...
